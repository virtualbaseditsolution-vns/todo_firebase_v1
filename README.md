Note - Please give importance to following correct coding conventions. Plus points for Awesome UI / UX. Please create great screens. 

We would be assessing this assignment from the POV of a Senior Flutter Developer. Ensure you write clean code, use solid principles and use latest coding conventions.

For state Management, please use the Provider and Consumer Model. No other state management will be accepted.
